This document is broken up by the subfolders folders which contain the entire mechanical design of our CartPole Project.
Please do not hesitate to reach me at philsieg@seas.upenn.edu with any questions. 

1. CAD
	This folder contains all of the 3D models as Solidworks Parts and Assemblies without fasteners. 

2. Documents 
	a) Instructions  
		This folder contains the assembly instructions along with the Bill of Materials. 
	b) Drawings - PDF
		This folder contains all of drawings referenced in the assembly instructions. Note: for parts that were machined,
		the default units are inches because the Lathes and Mills at UPenn operate using standard units. If you are ever 
		confused about the units for the partiuclar drawing, it says in the bottom right whether the default dimensions
		are in milimeters or inches. 	 

3. STL 
	This folder contains all of the STL files for parts which were 3D printed. They were made using a Dekstop FDM with PLA. 

4. DWG	
	This folder contains all of the DWG's for parts which were laser cut from 1/4" MDF. 

5. PT4
	This folder contains all of the prototrack files for the parts that had prototrack components and were made using Mills.
